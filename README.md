# Multiplayer Chat/Move PoC

The goal is to provide a multiplayer
2D world with chat. Each player must
have the ability to move around.

## Source Projects

We shamelessly stole the bulk of this project from [this client-server example](https://gitlab.com/menip/godot-multiplayer-tutorials/-/blob/master/LobbylessTutorial/LobbylessTut.md).  Thank you to the original author!

We drew further inspiration from [this chat example](http://www.narwalengineering.com/2018/07/01/godot-tutorial-simple-chat-room-using-multiplayer-api/).  Thank you!

## Additional Reading

In addition to the [official multiplayer docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html), we found [this cheatsheet](https://blog.iancolwell.ca/godot-multiplayer-networking-cheatsheet) helpful.
