# Multiplayer Chat/Move PoC

These applications constitute a prototype for a multiplayer, 2D world with chat. 
We use a client/server approach, such that the server could be hosted on a cloud
provider and run in headless mode.

Each player has the ability to move around, in addition to being able to chat.

## Source Projects

We shamelessly stole the bulk of this project from [this client-server example](https://gitlab.com/menip/godot-multiplayer-tutorials/-/blob/master/LobbylessTutorial/LobbylessTut.md).  Thank you to [menip](http://twitter.com/MenipTweet) for providing this code!

We drew further inspiration from [this chat example](http://www.narwalengineering.com/2018/07/01/godot-tutorial-simple-chat-room-using-multiplayer-api/).  Thank you!
